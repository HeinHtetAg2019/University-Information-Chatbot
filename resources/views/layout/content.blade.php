				<h1>Website chatbots</h1>
				<p>We’ve come a long way from the days of “live chat” on websites. These days chatbots are intelligent and capable of completing a host of different tasks. Everything from booking meetings with sales reps to pushing prospects further down the funnel with engaging content can be done.</p>
				<p>Leading the charge in chatbot innovation is Drift, which launched its conversational marketing platform less than two years ago. With Drift, businesses can connect with website visitors on a one-to-one basis, and book meetings prospects in real-time, all with the help of a chatbot.
